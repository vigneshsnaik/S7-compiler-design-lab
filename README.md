# KTU Compiler Design Lab

## Cycle I (Submit by 13/8/2024 - 4/9/2024)

- **Design and Implement a Lexical Analyzer**
  - Create a lexical analyzer for a given language using C.
  - The analyzer should ignore redundant spaces, tabs, and newlines.
- **Program to Find ε – Closure of All States of an NFA with ε Transition**
- **Program to Convert NFA with ε Transition to NFA without ε Transition**
- **Program to Convert NFA to DFA**
- **Program to Minimize Any Given DFA**

## Cycle II (Submit by 10/9/2024 - 8/10/2024)

- **Write a Lex Program**
  - Recognize all strings which do not contain the first four characters of your name as a substring.
- **Write a YACC Program**
  - Recognize a valid variable which starts with a letter followed by any number of letters or digits.
- **Implementation of Calculator**
  - Implement a calculator using LEX and YACC.
- **Convert BNF Rules into YACC Form**
  - Write code to generate an abstract syntax tree.
- **Write a YACC Program**
  - Check the syntax of the `FOR` statement in C.

## Cycle III (Submit by 9/10/2024 – 22/10/2024)

- **Develop an Operator Precedence Parser**
  - Implement a parser for a given language.
- **Simulate First and Follow**
  - Write a program to simulate the First and Follow sets of any given grammar.
- **Construct a Recursive Descent Parser**
  - Create a recursive descent parser for an expression.
- **Construct a Shift-Reduce Parser**
  Implement a shift-reduce parser for a given language.

## Cycle IV (Submit by 23/10/2024 – 30/10/2024)

- **Implement Intermediate Code Generation**
  - Implement code generation for simple expressions.
- **Implement the Backend of the Compiler**
  - Create the backend that converts three-address code into 8086 assembly language instructions.
  - Instructions may include simple operations such as move, add, sub,  and jump.
